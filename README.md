# pc8funcs-module
My module containing functions that may come in handy.
Requires: Unix or Linux OS, Python3, pip3.
After downloading setup.py and pc8funcs.py, type this command into the terminal:

`python3 setup.py sdist`

After running that command it will give you lots of messages. Running that command would have created two folders: dist and pc8funcs.egg-info. Type `cd dist` and you will be in the dist folder. Type the following to complete the process:

`pip3 install pc8funcs-1.0.tar.gz`

Open the Python 3 shell and import the module to check if it works.
